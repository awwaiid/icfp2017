The `server` implements offline-mode in the game and lets us test and tune.

All of our bots have a wrapper-bot, named bots/metabot. This bot:

* Handles run-length json encoding
* Sets up game-start state
* Pre-calculates some lookup tables for state, such as river claims
* When a move is received, calculates the new state from the previous
* Simplifies handshake to bots
* Records the real bot's move into the state and sents it to the server
* Merges in any special state from individual bots

Currently our collection of bots are independent, but we hope to use an
ensemble style voting or heuristic across several bots to make the best move.

NOTE: Rakudo P6 appears to produce 'precomp' files. Not sure how to turn that
off, but it isn't state relevant to the game.
